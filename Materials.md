# Materials

I'd like to note that there's... Many different factors to take into account when it comes to the subject of adding new materials. While variety is appreciated, too many will likely simply feel like... Filler, making things more convoluted. For these reasons, it's important to make every material feel unique, and give it purpose.

## Take vanilla Minecraft:

Wood is the weakest, but the starter material. Everyone uses wood at some point.

Stone is extremely easy to get ahold of after wood, being a straight up upgrade to it.

Iron is more difficult to get ahold of than stone, but it doesn't take too long to get full iron. It is the staple- every mid game player has iron equipment, and several redstone components include iron.

Redstone, while not useful for equipment, is useful for automation and wiring, making it stand out.

Gold is bad for tools- as they have very low durability, although they ARE the fastest in the game. However, it can be used to make some of the best foods in the game, such as golden apples and golden carrots.

Diamond is rare, and difficult to get ahold of in large quantities, and needed for things such as the enchantment table. It isn't a metal, and therefore doesn't need to be smelted- in addition, the fortune enchantment works on it.

Netherite is even rarer than diamond, and can only be found in the nether. It doesn't have an ore form, and is instead only found as ancient debris, which must be smelted into ancient scrap, which then must be combined with gold in order to make a Netherite ingot, which can be used to upgrade diamond equipment.

## Some concepts for the stats of materials

### Hardness

A component in determining piercing damage, and a major component of armor toughness. Also a major component of determining piercing value. Determines blunt damage to some extent.

### Edge-Holding

How well the material sharpens and holds an edge. A higher value means more piercing damage. A bit unnecessary, honestly, but I think it adds something. I can't really explain what tho lol

### Workability

Similar to heat, but more complex. Your “workability limit” is determined mostly by the quality of your smithing/crafting tools and stations, as well as the anvil. Working on something with too low workability decreases the stats of the final product. The tiers go something like this: Very High (can be worked by hand, with simple wooden stations and tools), High (requires stone stations and tools), Medium (requires iron stations and tools, first proper anvil is at this stage), Low (requires iron, diamond and obsidian tools and stations), and Very Low (requires exceptionally powerful tools and stations- likely powered by the blue substance or other methods)

Also, the higher up you go, the larger the workability penalties. Working with medium workability materials, such as iron, with stone stations and tools, will only yield a small decrease in stats, but working very low workability materials with obsidian and diamond tools will yield a much more significant decrease. This is essentially a way to a) gate progression behind certain workstations and tools, b) provide more ~immersion~, and c) make high workability materials, which are usually less powerful, more useful, since they gain bonus stat points, explained in the “Actual Smithing Stuff” section.

### Density

fairly simple. More density means the tool is slower, whether that is in its mining speed, or attack speed. More density can be good in some cases, for example for hammers or other blunt force weapons. Essentially, more density=more weight. In addition, the weight of equipment determines weight penalties, and whether it can be used two-handed. Honestly, probably one of the central stats of the mod. The weight of equipment, determined by its density, determines SO many things. Yeah baby we're adding density to minecraft and its not education edition

### Durability

How durable the material is. Also fairly self explanatory. It's the main influence of the final durability of a certain component, and as a result, of the tool. Fun fact, with all the different stats there are, we can do things like make emerald not just “iron stats but more durability”. It's incredible.

### Heat Requirement

Heat needed to work a material. Likely divided into tiers: None, low (achievable with early equipment- furnaces, campfires), medium (requires later overworld materials, such as blast furnaces and lava), high (requires nether materials, magma furnaces, blaze rods), and very high (requires the highest tier of heating equipment, possibly powered by ancient civilization technology, and/or the blue substance) Know how workability has three different functions? Yeah heat requirement is just two of those, gating progression and immersion. Mostly gating progression tbh.

### Padding

Only for certain armor materials. Increases resistance to all attacks by a bit, especially blunt. Mainly for gambeson and whatnot. Since armor is more based on random numbers than in normal minecraft, padding gambeson is a way to ensure all damage is reduced at least a bit.

### Special Effect

Some materials provide special effects when the major component of something is made from it. magic

## Materials

### Wood

Reliable, relatively sturdy, plentiful and easy to work. Wood has many, many uses.

Wood: Light material, with decent durability, and very bad sharpened capabilities. Works alright as a spear. Absorbs XP surprisingly well, but doesn't let go of it very well, making it bad for storage. Different types of wood have aesthetic differences, but produce no stat changes.

- How to Get: All trees.

- Pattern Effect: WIP

- Hardness: 4, Medium-Low

- Edge-Holding: 2.5, Low

- Workability: Very High

- Density: 300, Low

- Durability: 200, Low

- XP capacity: 20, Medium

- XP absorption: 20, Medium

- Heat Requirement: None

- Padding: 0

- Special Effect: None

Just the regular early-game material, with density and durability that might make it alright for handles and such later in the game.

### Stone

Hard. But not very. Heavy, but not very durable. It's... Decent.

Stone: Very heavy, and more durable than wood. It isn't too hard to work with, and works well enough for spears, sword, pickaxes, hammers, etc. Doesn't interact with any magic in any remarkable way.
- How to Get: 99% of what is under the dirt layer
- Pattern Effect: Increased weight, no XP cost.
- Hardness: 5, Medium
- Edge-Holding: 3.9, Medium-Low
- Workability: High
- Density: 700, Medium-high
- Durability: 250, Low
- XP capacity: 10, Low
- XP absorption: 5, Very Low
- Heat Requirement: None
- Padding: -1
- Special Effect: None
Honestly? Pretty awful material. It kinda sucks. But it's a stepping stone.

### Leather

Durable, easy to work. I could probably make some pretty lightweight armor with this.
Leather: Tough, light animal hide, useful for armor.
- How to Get: Killing cows, rabbits.
- Pattern Effect: Slightly increased padding.
- Hardness: 0.5, Low
- Edge-Holding: -1, None
- Workability: Very High
- Density: 150, Low
- Durability: 250, Medium-Low
- XP capacity: 25, Medium
- XP absorption: 10, Low
- Heat Requirement: None
- Padding: 20, Medium
- Special Effect: None
A fairly good source of padding, although it doesn't have excellent durability, it's still a good option for armor. Since it has an edge-holding of -1, you can't make weapons out of it. No leather greatsword.


### Flint

Harder to come across than stone, it seems, but much easier to work. It's a nice material for some of the basic tools I may need.
Flint: About the same durability as stone, about the same weight, but easier to sharpen and work with. Though better than stone, it's not as abundant. Same as stone when it comes to magic.
- How to Get: Breaking gravel.
- Pattern Effect: Adds 5% fire damage. Does nothing on armor.
- Hardness: 4.9, Medium
- Edge-Holding: 4.5, Medium
- Workability: High
- Density: 660, Medium
- Durability: 300, Medium-Low
- XP capacity: 10, Low
- XP absorption: 10, Low
- Heat Requirement: None
- Padding: -1
- Special Effect: None
Decent, I suppose? Certainly a better material than stone. The pattern effect of adding some fire elemental damage could be useful, though.

### Bone

Skeleton bone. Pretty brittle, but very light. Makes some nasty, sharp splinters when broken.
Bone: Lighter than wood, but worse durability. Harder to get ahold of, but not difficult. Can be sharpened fairly well. Doesn't absorb XP particularly well.
- How to Get: Skeletons, limited other mobs such as wither skeletons.
- Pattern Effect: Undead mobs drop more loot when slain, equivalent to vanilla Looting I. On armor, it provides 10% resistance to decay magic damage per piece.
- Hardness: 5, Medium
- Edge-Holding: 3.8, Medium-Low
- Workability: High
- Density: 200, Low
- Durability: 100, Very Low
- XP capacity: 25, Medium
- XP absorption: 25, Medium
- Heat Requirement: None
- Padding: 0
- Special Effect: Armor made from bone provides resistance to decay magic damage. Each piece provides 25% resistance, that applies after all other resistances. A full set provides immunity.
Not great, but pretty light. The pattern effect is essentially early-game looting for only undead mobs, which is kinda useful. The pattern could be useful in some scenarios, and I really needed that special effect to make bone armor useful in some niche scenarios, because bone armor is badass.


### Iron

Metal! While this is certainly heavier than wood, it should be much stronger than any non-metal I've discovered so far. I'll need some heat to work it properly, though. It also brings about a feeling of heat.

Iron: Metal found abundantly in the overworld. Although heavy compared to wood, it is about average for a metal, with good durability. Although harder to work with than previous materials, as it requires heat, it sharpens well, and is generally a staple material. Absorbs and releases XP... Fairly well, but nothing spectacular. Although it can be used for storage of small amounts of the blue substance, any higher and/or concentrated quantities will break iron. Weakly leads red substance.
- How to Get: Found abundantly in all of the overworld.
- Pattern Effect: Increases attack speed by 10%.
- Hardness: 7, Medium-High
- Edge-Holding: 5.8, Medium
- Workability: Medium
- Density: 600, Medium
- Durability: 600, Medium
- XP capacity: 30, Medium
- XP absorption: 25, Medium
- Heat Requirement: Medium (along with copper, it can still be worked with Low heat sources, just at a stat loss)
- Padding: 0
- Special Effect: None. It's iron.
Iron. Gonna be real with you, it's kinda like a baseline material in some ways. I base several things off of things like the iron broadsword. And like, look at the stats. Basically all designated as “medium”. The pattern effect is because well, iron, mars, god of war, y'know?


### Copper

Another common metal. It seems to respond well to certain magical forces, though I'm not quite sure which ones. It also brings about a feeling of excitement.
Copper: Similar to iron, but better durability, though otherwise a bit worse. However, it is very useful for many red magic applications, leading it fairly well.
- How to Get: Found abundantly above the deepslate layer in the overworld. Spawns in bigger clusters than iron, but more rarely. With -64 depth, spawns above depth 0.
- Pattern Effect: Adds 8% thunder damage. Grants 10% resistance to thunder damage per armor piece patterned with copper.
- Hardness: 6.5, Medium
- Edge-Holding: 5, Medium-Low
- Workability: Medium
- Density: 570, Medium
- Durability: 700, Medium
- XP capacity: 30, Medium
- XP absorption: 40, High
- Heat Requirement: Medium (along with iron, it can still be worked with Low heat sources, just at a stat loss)
- Padding: 0
- Special Effect: Being hit by lightning charges the equipment. Weapons deal high thunder elemental damage for the next 8-16 hits, armor deals high thunder elemental damage the next 8-16 times the person wearing it is hit, and shields deal high thunder elemental damage the next 8-16 times the shield is hit.
Not super useful, but has a bit more durability than iron. The special effect is niche, but could be fun, mostly. Has a magical connection or whatever, with electricity and thunder damage. Association or something. Makes it have some uses later in the game.


### Gold

Mostly worthless, from what I've seen. Easy to work with a little bit of heat, but not very useful from tools. It makes a strange sensation when I come close to it, though- perhaps it is unusually receptive to magic forces?
Gold: Very heavy, quite low durability. Very easy to work with, but still requires heat. Absorbs XP extremely well, and releases it quite readily- suited for storage of it. Leads red substance well, for certain applications.
- How to Get: Found rarely, with more the deeper you go. Also found all over the nether as nether gold ore. Decreased rates of the ore compared to vanilla. However, they are found in big, rare veins.
- Pattern Effect: On armor, counts as gold armor for piglins. Increased XP capacity and absorption by 15.
- Hardness: 2.5,  Low
- Edge-Holding: 2, Low
- Workability: High
- Density: 1150, Very High
- Durability: 150, Low
- XP capacity: 100, Exceptionally High
- XP absorption: 100, Exceptionally High
- Heat Requirement: Low
- Padding: 3
- Special Effect: None
For equipment? Bad. Maybe you could make some neat super magical weapon with it, but it'll probably be kinda trash. However, useful for magic setups (something with barely anything written at the time of this writing) and of course, patterning equipment to give it more XPC, which is really useful.


### Silver

I'm not quite sure what to use this metal for, but it feels... Potent. Holding even an ingot of this metal seems to fill me with an urge to slay undead beings. Strange.
Silver: Lighter than gold, decently easy to work with, though it isn't particularly durable and doesn't hold an edge very well. However, it not only absorbs and releases XP well- not like gold, but still well- it is surprisingly resistant to the blue substance. This means it is the first material a player will have access to for blue substance uses. While the tools one could build using silver machinery would be powerful for the stage of the game where silver is found, the silver components will still likely break even before all of the energy is used, giving it very low durability.
- How to Get: Found occasionally, more commonly than gold, up to a bit higher than gold. Smaller veins than gold.
- Pattern Effect: Adds a 5% smite damage.
- Hardness: 5, Medium-Low
- Edge-Holding: 5, Medium-Low
- Workability: Medium
- Density: 800, Medium-High
- Durability: 670, Medium
- XP capacity: 45, High
- XP absorption: 30, Medium
- Heat Requirement: Medium
- Padding: 0
- Special Effect: Each time an undead mob is hit by a silver weapon, it becomes weaker and slower temporarily. This effect stacks, and the magnitude of it depends on the damage dealt. An undead mob striking armor or a shield made from silver suffers the same effect, though weaker.
Uuuuuh it's associated with like, smite damage, which is probably the strongest damage type in the game, except for the fact that basically everything that deals smite damage deals *very little* smite damage. But still. Good for killing undead things. Oh yeah, blue magic uses. It's important there. It's been forever since I touched blue magic at the time of this writing.


I've come across a blue substance I've named lapis lazuli. It seems to react in interesting ways with magic; while it doesn't absorb it, it might act as a catalyst.
Lapis Lazuli: Cannot be used for tools, but needed for almost all green magic. In addition, it can be used for intricate patterns.
How to Get: Found like in vanilla, in both deep stone and deepslate.
Pattern Effect: 40% more XP gathered from mobs.
Useful for a bunch of magical stuff. Also good for getting extra XP from mobs. For example, specialized mob grinder weapon.


An abundant metal. It feels like a rock, not in weight or texture, but in... Feeling. Perhaps it is not receptive to any kind of magic?
Lead: Lighter than gold, though heavier than silver, and much more abundant. Blocks almost all magic, making it useful for transportation of it in combination with other materials. It is also more durable than gold, though harder to work with.
How to Get: Found occasionally deeper down than iron. With -64 depth, spawns only above depth 0. Small veins.
Pattern Effect: Attacks inflict 10% poison damage (slow poison).
Hardness: 4.5, Low
Edge-Holding: 2.6, Low
Workability: High
Density: 950, High
Durability: 300, Medium-Low
XP capacity: 4, Extremely Low
XP absorption: 4, Extremely Low
Heat Requirement: Low
Padding: 1
Special Effect: None but I guess if a mod adds radiation, armor or shields made from lead could give radiation resistance lol
Pretty bad for equipment, but the pattern effect is useful, and it's used in enchanting. Likely will have some uses in magic setups.


Material left over from turtles maturing. Quite hard for an organic material, and seems to have some natural affinity towards water magic.
Scute: Hardness like iron, but can't be used for tools, and more durability. Grants increased water breathing.
How to Get: Drops when a baby turtle grows into an adult turtle.
Pattern Effect: 5 seconds of extra water breathing time for each armor piece patterned. Removes the mining slowdown usually present when in water when a tool is patterned.
Hardness: 7, Medium-High
Edge-Holding: -1, None
Workability: Medium
Density: 550
Durability: 850, Medium-High
XP Capacity: 30, Medium
XP Absorption: 30, Medium
Heat Requirement: None
Padding: 10
Special Effect: Each armor piece made from scutes provides 10 seconds of extra water breathing.
I kinda forgot this existed for a while. I barely ever get it. But hey, good for being in the water.


Mercury: Unsure if it should be treated as a liquid or solid. In either case, it cannot be made into tools. It is found rarely in the overworld, but more commonly in the nether. Useful for body upgrades, as it absorbs into the body well.
How to Get: Found very deep down, in the deepslate layer. With -64 depths, spawns only under 0. Small veins.
Not used for equipment.
Really important, actually! Has some uses in enchanting, but above that, a *lot* of soul upgrades involve mercury. And yes, this mod encourages using mercury inside your body. The toxic heavy metal. (Jokes aside, it's one of the metals of antiquity, that's kinda why it's included, and well, it was seen as pretty magic by lots of cultures, I believe. Which like. Yeah?? It's a liquid fucking metal. Obviously it's magic)


I've devised a way to make iron stronger and better! By burning it together with charcoal, it turns into a metal I call steel, which is not just stronger, but harder and tougher, too! Though it is a bit more difficult to work, I should be able to make high quality equipment with this metal.
Steel: Created by combining iron, marble and charcoal (I'm still not sure as to the details of this process), and is harder to work with. However, it has higher durability and sharpens better. It has a drawback though- the coal severely reduces its ability to absorb XP.
How to Get: Alloying iron, marble and charcoal in an alloy furnace (new structure).
Pattern Effect: Decreases knockback taken by 15% when an armor piece is patterned. Decreases knockback dealt by 20% when used on a weapon.
Hardness: 7.5, Medium-High
Edge-Holding: 7, Medium-High
Workability: Medium
Density: 590, Medium
Durability: 850, Medium-High
XP capacity: 10, Low
XP absorption: 15, Low
Heat Requirement: Medium
Padding: 0
Special Effect: None
It's like iron. But better. But also worse because less XPC. Honestly not *that* much purpose to it. Could be removed, but then again, steel.


Amethyst: Found in amethyst clusters. Though low durability for a crystal, it deals more damage than diamond tools.
How to Get: Found within amethyst geodes.
Pattern Effect: All damage dealt by weapon increased by 5%.
Hardness: 9, High
Edge-Holding: 10, Very High
Workability: Low
Density: 400, Medium-Low
Durability: 200, Low
XP capacity: 30, Medium
XP Absorption: 40, Medium-High
Heat Requirement: None
Padding: -1
Special Effect: None
I was actually really unsure what to do with amethysts. I think this is a decent?? Use tho. Low durability, but really good damage. Maybe I'll have to lower the durability even more. To make it like gold tools, y'know? Technically good, but not really... Btw, I think it had 13? Edge-holding before I adjusted it down to 10. 13?? Wtf


Shiny! Villagers seem to enjoy this gem, and they have it in abundance. Strange, as it is so rare to find otherwise. Nevertheless, it is difficult to use for tools- it is much too hard.
Emerald: Rarer than diamond, but commonly traded by villagers. Good durability, but hard to work and sharpen. 
How to Get: Villager trading, rarely under mountain biomes.
Pattern Effect: All mobs drop slightly more loot, equivalent to looting I in vanilla.
Hardness: 6.5, Medium
Edge-Holding: 7, Medium-High
Workability: Low
Density: 440, Medium-Low
Durability: 770, Medium-High
XP capacity: 35, High
XP absorption: 20, Medium
Heat Requirement: None
Padding: -1
Special Effect: None
It's like budget diamonds. That's it basically. Which is ironic, considering you're basically making stuff out of money.


Diamond! This rare crystal ought to make excellent equipment, being exceedingly hard... Though very difficult to work, it seems. I may have to come up with new ways to work substances.
Diamond: Much rarer than gold, and very difficult to work with, although it requires no heat. Sharpens very well, and is lighter than most metals. Extremely durable. Blue substance passes through it without much effort, but can be reflected and manipulated by it.
How to Get: Found rarely deep within the world, becoming more common further down. Same with added depth, becoming even more common below 0. However, veins are quite a bit rarer than in vanilla. Vanilla vein size.
Pattern Effect: All equipment stats are increased by 2%, except weight, which isn't affected.
Hardness: 7, Medium-High
Edge-Holding: 8, High
Workability: Low
Density: 460, Medium-Low
Durability: 1300, Very High
XP capacity: 35, Medium-High
XP absorption: 45, High
Heat Requirement: None
Padding: -1
Special Effect: None
Can no longer be used for armor, unlike in vanilla (although this is true for all crystals in the mod). This reduces the amount of textures that have to be made for armor, and also, crystals are apparently really bad for armor. Metals also have a crystal structure, but, whatever. They're also rarer than in vanilla, mostly because I think diamonds are too easy to get ahold of normally. Probably less useful than in vanilla overall. Is a baseline for blue magic purposes.


It's like a rock, but heavier. And harder. Maybe I can make a nice anvil out of it?
Obsidian: Heavy, very hard to work with, and sharpens rather poorly. However, it is extremely durable, and good for anvils. Conducts purple magic well.
How to Get: Created when lava is cooled down by water.
Pattern Effect: Resistance to fire (not lava), 30% increased durability.
Hardness: 11, High
Edge-Holding: 5.7, Medium
Workability: Low
Density: 1000, Very High
Durability: 1000, High
XP capacity: 15, Low
XP absorption: 10, Low
Heat Requirement: High
Padding: -1
Special Effect: Hitting an entity with a weapon made from obsidian temporarily disables their ability to teleport.
Mostly used in anvils and such, but has other uses. It's high hardness, density and durability may mean it's good for blunt weapons. Which is a bit ironic, considering in real life I believe obsidian has mostly been used for sharp weaponry. But, well, minecraft obsidian seems fairly different from the real life equivalent. Should also be good for purple magic once that's more developed.


Quartz: Doesn't absorb XP well, but releases it extremely quickly, and can store a lot of it. Bad for tools.
How to Get: Spawns abundantly within the nether.
Pattern Effect: 
Not used in tools(?)
I don't think the pattern effect of heavily increasing XPC is very good, since I'd like the role of increasing XPC to belong to gold. Not sure what to do with quartz in that case, though. Could very well not be used for patterning.


Ugh. These bones give me the chills. They seem to be pretty tough, but... Something about them feels off. Like they just want to be left alone.
Wither Bones: Bones from wither skeletons. Strong, but reject XP magic outright.
How to Get: Drops sometimes from wither skeletons.
Pattern Effect: Increases durability by 50%, but equipment can't be enchanted with XP.
Hardness: 7.4, Medium-High
Edge-Holding: 4.5, Medium-Low
Workability: Medium
Density: 150, Low
Durability: 980, High
XP capacity: 0, None
XP absorption: 0, None
Heat Requirement: None
Padding: 0
Special Effect: Weapons made from wither bones deal 5% decay magic damage.
An interesting material. Very light and high durability, but cannot be enchanted. The pattern effect is also interesting, providing a major durability increase but at the cost of enchantments. Probably not useful most of the time, but could have niche uses.


While in the nether, I found a hard, very heavy kind of metal. Though it seems difficult to work with, it may prove useful for blunt weapons, as I've never encountered a heavier material before.
Osmium: Extremely heavy- even more so than obsidian. Only found in the nether. Has good durability, close to that of diamond, and is extremely difficult to work, requiring large amounts of heat. However, when it comes to density, Osmium trumps everything else.
How to Get: Rarely spawns in large clusters in the nether, near ancient debris depth, though also higher than that. Spawns rarely in small clusters even higher. Can be exposed to the surface.
Pattern Effect: Increases hardness and weight.
Hardness: 5, High
Edge-Holding: 10, High
Workability: Low
Density: 1400, Extremely High
Durability: 1100, Medium
XP capacity: 30, Medium
XP absorption: 20, Medium-Low
Heat Requirement: High
Padding: 0
Special Effect: None
One of the heaviest materials in the game, and the heaviest of the regular materials. Also has good edge-holding, but the density of it means it likely won't be very useful for piercing damage weapons. However, the density of it should make it good for blunt weapons. Also has acceptable XPC.


These gems seem to all be fairly similar to each other- I've named them “Corundum”. They all seem to react differently to the blue magic.
Corundum: Corundum ore is found in the nether, and when mined, will yield a few different crystals, useful for energized tools. Each type of corundum crystal reacts differently with blue magic.
How to Get: Found in small clusters all over the nether. Each cluster is mostly the same gem type. Star gems spawn in clusters of one.
Sapphire Pattern Effect: Increases durability by 20%, decreases hardness of the head component by 1.
Ruby Pattern Effect: Decreases durability by 25%, increases hardness of the head component by 1.
Lotus Gem (Padparadscha) Pattern Effect: Increases durability by 15%.
Star Gem: Pattern Effect: Decreases durability by 25%, increases all other stats except weight by 4%.
Hardness: 8, High
Edge-Holding: 8, High
Workability: Low
Density: 390, Medium-low
Durability: 680, Medium
XP capacity: 15, Low
XP absorption: 15, Low
Heat Requirement: None
Padding: -1
Special Effect: None
Not too impressive when it comes to their stats, but each different type of corundum has different effects when used for blue magic. If blue magic is removed, it wouldn't be a particularly interesting material. The pattern effects are interesting, but I don't know if they're enough to warrant inclusion in the mod.


I seem to have found a material I call ancient debris in the depths of the nether. Though it can't be processed on its own, when alloyed with gold, it seems to be incredibly resilient. In addition, given high enough heat, it becomes decently easy to work with.
Netherite: Found rarely in the form of ancient debris in the nether, or even more rarely, as pure netherite ore, which can be smelted directly into four netherite pieces, which can be combined with gold. Quite light for a metal, but exceedingly durable. It is very difficult to work, requiring powerful forges to heat. However, once it is heated above a certain level- which is a difficult task- it becomes easy to work, similar to gold. In this state, it can be used to plate other components, providing a significant boost in durability and sharpness/power. Is alright at absorbing XP when in its pure form, but more notably, it can withstand the power of concentrated blue substance, making it a viable option for components handling it.
How to Get: Obtained like in vanilla, through mining ancient debris, though it has to be alloyed with gold in an upgraded alloy oven, with the same proportions (4+4-->1). Can also obtain raw netherium chunks from the rare netherium ore found near bedrock, which has a similar brown colouration. 2 netherium chunks and 4 gold make one ingot.
Pattern Effect: Equipment can't burn in fire.
Hardness: 9.5, Very High
Edge-Holding: 9, Very High
Workability: Very Low with High heat, Low with Very High heat
Density: 630, Medium
Durability: 1500, Very High
XP capacity: 40, High
XP absorption: 40, High
Heat Requirement: High heat for Very Low workability, Very High for Low Workability
Padding: 0
Special Effect: Equipment doesn't burn in fire.
A top tier material. Has excellent edge-holding and hardness, and low density, meaning it's mostly useful for armor and piercing damage weapons. Excellent durability and XPC means it's all around a very useful material, if hard to get ahold of in large quantities. With a powerful heat source, the workability of netherite increases, meaning you can gain some extra stat points. I also lowered the workability at very high heat from medium to low, since a medium workability would likely prove too powerful.


This metal, aluminium, is very light, and seems to be very uncommon in my home world. However, given other conditions, it could most likely be much more common. It seems useful for certain applications, but it isn't very durable for a metal. It also brings about a feeling of chill.
Aluminium: Extremely rare in the overworld, but quite common in the end. The lightest metal available, it is easy to work, and has alright durability. Useful for making light yet viable tools.
How to Get: Spawns very rarely in veins of 1-3 in the overworld deepslate layer. With -64 depth, spawns only below 0. Spawns relatively commonly in larger veins in the end islands.
Pattern Effect: Adds ice elemental damage.
Hardness: 5.5, Medium
Edge-Holding: 6.8, Medium-High
Workability: High
Density: 320, Medium-Low
Durability: 400, Medium-low
XP capacity: 32, Medium-High
XP absorption: 12, Low
Heat Requirement: Medium
Padding: 0
Special Effect: None?
A fun quirk of being exceedingly rare in the overworld, but still possible to acquire, and then common in the end, mimicking the fact that aluminium was very rare and valuable in the real world, until it was discovered how to extract aluminium from its ore, as previously you could only use aluminium found in its native form. Useful for rings, and quite light tools, but has poor XPA. Also has connections to ice damage and the cold.


This otherworldly metal is quite strong, and seems to respond to magic better than the charcoal-infused steel. It also seems to respond especially well to invisibility magic.
Titanium: Slightly better than steel in most aspects, but more difficult to work. Found in the end and rarely in the nether. Unlike steel, it is alright for magic, absorbing XP well enough.
How to Get: Spawns rarely in small veins in the nether. However, it spawns more commonly in the end, though still not very common, and still in small veins.
Pattern Effect: Equipment can't be seen while invisible.
Hardness: 7.7, Medium-High
Edge-Holding: 7.5, High
Workability: Low
Density: 450, Medium-Low
Durability: 900, Medium-High
XP capacity: 35, Medium
XP absorption: 15, Medium-Low
Heat Requirement: High
Padding: 0
Special Effect: Equipment can't be seen while invisible.
Can be acquired, with some difficulty, in the nether, but becomes easier once access to the end is gained (although mining the end islands is dangerous, of course). Solid overall stats, and doesn't have steel's weakness of poor XPC, although its XPA leaves much to be desired. Very useful for those that which to pursue stealth and invisibility because of its pattern and special effect.


This material is soft for a crystal, and is quite easy to work with. It also seems to respond to blue magic in interesting ways, as well as the void.
Endicite: Rather soft crystal, found only in the end. Good enchantability, easy to work, but not great durability. 
How to Get: Spawns rarely in the end islands, in small veins. Ore and endicite fall very slowly.
Pattern Effect: Equipment floats over the void, and doesn't despawn.
Hardness: 4, Medium
Edge-Holding: 3.1, Medium-Low
Workability: High
Density: 5, Exceptionally Low
Durability: 150, Low
XP capacity: 35, High
XP absorption: 30, Medium-high
Heat Requirement: None
Padding: -1
Special Effect: Equipment floats over the void, and doesn't despawn. In addition, hitting an entity with an endicite weapon will disrupt their teleports for a couple of seconds, making any attempt to teleport deal 50% more damage (if any damage would be taken) and instead of teleporting to its destination, teleport randomly from their current location as if eating a chorus fruit.
It is, in fact, not an upgrade of netherite. Low overall stats, but its basically non-existent density can likely prove well worth it in some cases. In addition, the pattern effect can be useful to avoid losing equipment to the void, and the special effect could be useful for messing with those who like teleporting.


Leather processed from the hide of monsters. It's quite durable, and pretty soft. It will likely come in handy for lighter armor or clothing.
Monster Leather: The tough skin of certain powerful mobs. Surprisingly soft.
How to Get: Obtained from specific strong mobs.
Pattern Effect: Monsters have a harder time spotting you.
Hardness: 0.8, Low
Edge-Holding: -1, None
Workability: High
Density: 200, Low
Durability: 800, High
XP capacity: 26, Medium
XP absorption: 10, Low
Heat Requirement: None
Padding: 30, High
Special Effect: Wearing armor made from monster leather means monsters have a harder time spotting you.
A soft material with high padding and durability. Not much can be said about it, but it'll likely be a good material for most gambeson or light armor.


Wool. Soft, fluffy, and very easy to work with.
Wool: Soft wool from sheep or spider string.
How to Get: Obtained by killing or shearing sheep, or by crafting 4 string together.
Pattern Effect: Increases padding by 5 for armor, decreases weight by 5% for tools.
Hardness: 0.2, Very Low
Edge-Holding: -1, None
Workability: Very High
Density: 80, Very Low
Durability: 100, Low
XP capacity: 25, Medium
XP absorption: 10, Low
Heat Requirement: None
Padding: 20, Medium
Special Effect: If you wear armor made from wool when going to sleep, you regain one heart of health when you wake up. 
Wool is a very basic, cheap material. Bad durability and not that much padding. The pattern effect might be useful. But you can make cozy bedtime armor for a better night's sleep, so like...


Scales, obtained from powerful foes. They're quite resilient, and not quite metal, but not quite like leather, either, meaning they should be suitable for many types of armor.
Monster Scales: Scales dropped by certain powerful mobs.
How to Get: Killing specific bosses.
Pattern Effect: Increased hardness by 2, but only against boss-type mobs.
Hardness: 6.5, 8 vs Boss, Medium-High
Edge-Holding: -1, None
Workability: Medium
Density: 400, Medium-Low
Durability: 690, Medium-High
XP capacity: Low
XP absorption: Medium
Heat Requirement: None
Padding: 15, Medium
Special Effect: Increased hardness against boss-type mobs.
An interesting material with okay padding and hardness, but that gains increased hardness against boss-type mobs. Maybe not useful for everyday use, but could be good against, well, bosses.


A very durable cloth woven from spider string. Though not particularly soft or tough, the durability may come in handy.
Spider Weave: Extremely durable cloth woven from spider string.
How to Get: Crafted from 9 string together (?)
Pattern Effect: Increased hardness by 2 against neutral/passive mobs.
Hardness: 0.6, Low
Edge-Holding: -1, None
Workability: High
Density: 180, Low
Durability: 1300, Very High
XP capacity: 20, Medium
XP absorption: 40, High
Heat Requirement: None
Padding: 12, Low
Special Effect: None
Not great padding or hardness, but good durability. The pattern effect could be useful in some scenarios. Will probably have to be tweaked, since durability isn't a very useful defining trait.


A cloth created by weaving together the string of spiders and slime. Though not particularly durable or tough, it absorbs impacts remarkably well.
Slime Cloth: Thick fabric that softens impacts considerably, created by weaving together spider string and slime.
How to Get: Crafted with 4 string and 2 slime balls.
Pattern Effect: On boots, you bounce like on slime blocks, and take no fall damage. On all armor, mobs get knocked back when attacking you. On tools, increased knockback.
Hardness: 0.1, Extremely Low
Edge-Holding: -1, None
Workability: High
Density: 300, Medium-Low
Durability: 300, Medium-Low
XP capacity: 10, Low
XP absorption: 15, Low
Padding: 40, Very High
Special Effect: None
The best padding in the game, but at the cost of durability, and pretty bad density for a soft material. The pattern effect is fun, however.


Special Materials
I have managed to create a material I have called netherite, by alloying scraps of an ancient metal together with gold. It has an extraordinary strength, and will surely prove useful, but I am left wondering- were the civilizations of the past able to create materials even stronger than this?
These extreme materials can only be found near the remnants of ancient civilizations, almost always in the form of the equipment or components stored there.


Void Metal: Has practically no weight, and is faintly translucent. I am unsure as to what its other properties would be, as well as its name.
How to Get: Obtained from Void Chambers, perhaps some process involving the void?
Pattern Effect: When all armor pieces are patterned, the player becomes barely visible. Armor pieces don't appear when invisible. Any tool with one component patterned with Void Metal becomes barely visible, and can't be seen when invisible.
Hardness: 8.9, High
Edge-Holding: 9, High
Workability: Very Low
Density: 90, Extremely Low
Durability: 1000, High
XP capacity: 5, Very Low
XP absorption: 10, Low
Heat Requirement: High
Padding: 0
Good overall stats, and very low density, but basically no magic capacity, making its uses niche. Like all special materials, its primary source is through structures, but could be manufactured from scratch by dedicated individuals.


Pure Netherium: A quite light metal, with a very dark appearance. It is extremely strong, with few substances coming close to its durability- only netherite can hope to. The strongest tools of a player can barely budge a netherium component, and any normal source of heat barely affects it.
How to Get: Obtained from Bastions of Immortality, can be created with an eternicite catalyst lens structure.
Pattern Effect: Item can not be destroyed by lava or the void, and never despawns.
Hardness: 12, Extremely High
Edge-Holding: 11, Extremely High
Workability: Exceptionally Low
Density: 500, Medium-Low
Durability: 2000, Extremely High
XP capacity: 20, Medium
XP absorption: 10, Low
Heat Requirement: Very High
Padding: 0
One of the strongest materials in the game- its essentially purified netherite. However, it is the most difficult to work in the game, and has bad magic capacity. Creating it oneself will require an immense purifying and heating structure.


Neutronium: Extremely heavy- several times heavier than osmium. Yeah, I lied about osmium. It is also extremely durable, and practically impossible to work- to even make a scratch would take an astonishing amount of work. If one found a way to lift a hammer formed from neutronium, they would have one of the most powerful weapons in existence.
How to Get: Obtained from Stellar Forges, can be obtained through very powerful presses? Purple magic?
Pattern Effect: Heavily increased weight.
Hardness: 12, Exceptionally High
Edge-Holding: 11, Extremely High
Workability: Very Low
Density: 1800, Exceptionally High
Durability: 1500, Very High
XP capacity: 45, High
XP absorption: 24, Medium
Heat Requirement: Very High
Padding: 0
A lot of things about netherium have had to be tweaked. Even if it's really slow, the single-hit damage is just too much. It's a material essentially designed to be extreme, and as such is obviously difficult to balance.


Divinum: A divine metal that is very tough. All things forged from this metal deal magic damage, and striking armor made from Divinum leads to the attacker taking magic damage.
How to Get: Obtained from Divine Temples, can be obtained through complicated divine rituals?
Pattern Effect: 7% smite damage.
Hardness: 7, High
Edge-Holding: 8, High
Workability: Low
Density: 660, Medium
Durability: 900, High
XP capacity: 55, Very High
XP absorption: 45, High
Heat Requirement: Very High
Padding: 0
Special Effects: Weapons forged from divinum deal 10% smite damage, and armor forged from it deal 0.5 smite damage every time the piece is hit.
Decent stats, but really good magic capacity, and deals smite damage on every hit, which is the least resisted damage type. This combination could probably prove too powerful, so numbers will have to be tweaked.


Star Metal: A metal harvested from the skies, far from the home of mortals. Has a high durability, and armor created from Star Metal blocks magic damage.
How to Get: Obtained from Star Fortresses, probably can't be gained from other sources.
Pattern Effect: Strong resistance against magic damage. On non-armor pieces, it gives extra durability.
Hardness: 8, Medium-high
Edge-Holding: 7, High
Workability: Low
Density: 590, Medium
Durability: 1300, Extremely High
XP Capacity: 30, Medium
XP Absorption: 60, Very High
Heat Requirement: High
Padding: 0
Special Effects: Each armor piece forged from star metal gives 15% protection against every type of magic damage.
Unlike other materials, this one might not be able to be created from scratch. Fairly good stats, but the ability to reduce magic damage taken is fairly unique. Numbers will likely have to be tweaked.


Mercurium: Not overly impressive, but regenerates durability over time. Important for high-tier soul upgrades.
How to Get: Obtained from Decaying Fountains, can somehow be crafted or created?
Pattern Effect: Slowly regenerate durability over time.
Hardness: 6.9, Medium-High
Edge-Holding: 6, Medium
Workability: Medium
Density: 690, Medium
Durability: 800, High
XP Capacity: 20, Medium
XP Absorption: 30, Medium
Heat Requirement: High
Padding: 0
Special Effect: Equipment regenerates durability over time.
The main purpose of mercurium is high-tier soul upgrades, but its ability to regenerate durability is useful, too. Otherwise, its stats are just decent.

Eternicite: Extremely durable crystal.
How to Get: Obtained from Void Chambers, can be created through a long and complicated process.
Pattern Effect: High chance for components to not take durability damage, similar to Unbreaking.
Hardness: 8.5, High
Edge-Holding: 6, Medium
Workability: Very Low
Density: 650, Medium
Durability: 3000, Exceptionally High
XP Capacity: 40, High
XP Absorption: 35, Medium-High
Heat Requirement: None
Padding: -1
It has a lot of durability. And good XPC. And good hardness. Actually seems really powerful. Prolly needs to be tweaked.
