I’m gonna start adding some thoughts to various features and suggestions, marked with italics.


### Modular Equipment
Tools, weapons and armor made from different materials. They can be modified and enchanted in many ways.


### Damage System
Several types of armor and damage, as armor has coverage, toughness and weight, while there’s piercing, blunt, elemental, and magical damage.


### Smithing System
Various workbenches, tools and ways of heating materials, used for processing and creating tools.


### Weight and Stamina
Stamina is a new stat, used for jumping a bit higher, sprinting and attacking faster, and even climbing small distances. Heavy armor increases stamina consumption, and wearing too heavy armor decreases inventory space.


### Magic Systems
Three different magic systems- blue magic is essentially power tools, being collected and concentrated from the air and sunlight, green magic is XP and enchanting, being collected from living beings and ores, while red magic is based on redstone, signaling, rituals and runes.


### Soul Upgrades and Accessories
Various accessories give a variety of effects, while soul upgrades stay through death, and provide other benefits such as being able to equip more accessories, or being better at forging things. Accessories can be easily switched out- soul upgrades are more difficult, likely lost upon switching them out.


### New Structures and mobs
Various new structures and mobs, with loot including rare materials, components, magic items, challenges, and upgrades.
